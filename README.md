## Academic Context

**Academic submission October 2024** - Created as a coursework prototype to demonstrate fundamental web development concepts including DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design. Progressively enhanced through November-December 2024 while learning Git workflows and software development best practices.

## Development Timeline

Started this as a class project in October 2024, then kept improving it:
- **Oct 2024**: Initial prototype for web dev coursework
- **Nov 2024**: Added persistence and study features during semester break
- **Dec 2024**: Final touches while learning more CSS/JS patterns
- **Dec 2024**: Added deck deletion after realizing I needed it while using the app

## What I Learned
Building this taught me vanilla JavaScript fundamentals, localStorage APIs, and responsive design. The biggest challenge was figuring out the deck filtering logic - took me way longer than expected! Also learned the importance of actually using your own software - that's how I discovered I needed deck deletion.

## Known Issues & Notes
- **Deck Deletion**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Deleting a deck permanently removes ALL cards in that deck - no undo!
- **Default Deck**: The "Default Deck" cannot be deleted (it's needed for the app to work)
- **Storage Limit**: Browser localStorage has size limits (~5-10MB typically)
- No search or filtering capabilities yet
- Limited to single browser/device (no cloud sync)

## Future Enhancements

- Search and filtering for large card collections
- Spaced repetition algorithm for better memory retention
- Import/export functionality for sharing decks
- Cloud sync for cross-device access
- Study statistics and progress analytics

## How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser - no build tools or server required! Works completely offline once loaded.
