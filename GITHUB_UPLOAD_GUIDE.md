# 🚀 FlashLearn GitHub Upload Guide

## 📸 Step 1: Take Screenshots

### Create Screenshots Folder
```bash
mkdir screenshots
```

### Required Screenshots
Take these 3 screenshots and save them as:

1. **`screenshots/main-interface.png`**
   - Show the main interface with:
   - Deck selector dropdown
   - Add flashcard form
   - A sample flashcard displayed
   - Navigation buttons visible

2. **`screenshots/study-mode.png`**
   - Click "🎯 Start Study Mode"
   - Show the clean study interface
   - Progress indicator visible
   - Make sure it looks focused/distraction-free

3. **`screenshots/mobile-view.png`**
   - Use browser dev tools (F12)
   - Set to mobile view (iPhone/Android size)
   - Take screenshot showing responsive layout
   - Buttons should stack vertically

### Screenshot Tips
- Use sample cards with realistic content (e.g., "What is the capital of France?" / "Paris")
- Make sure UI looks clean and professional
- Avoid any placeholder text like "Lorem ipsum"
- Good lighting and clear text

## 📝 Step 2: Add Screenshots to Markdown

The README.md already has the correct syntax:

```markdown
## Screenshots

### Main Interface
![Main Interface](screenshots/main-interface.png)
*The main flashcard interface with deck selection and card management*

### Study Mode
![Study Mode](screenshots/study-mode.png)
*Focused study mode with progress tracking and minimal distractions*

### Mobile View
![Mobile Responsive](screenshots/mobile-view.png)
*Responsive design works great on mobile devices*
```

### Markdown Image Syntax Explained
```markdown
![Alt Text](path/to/image.png)
*Optional caption in italics*
```

- **Alt Text**: Describes image for accessibility
- **Path**: Relative path from README.md location
- **Caption**: Optional descriptive text below image
